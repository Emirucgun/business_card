This project is **Beginner-Friendly**

I combined the first information that I learned about React native in this project. I used:
- **StyleSheet**
- **Text**
- **View**
- **Image**
- **TouchableOpacity**
- **Linking**
- **ScrollView** commands.


### 1- Profile Photo

* An aesthetic profile photo in the form of a circle on the left side of the card.


### 2- Name and Experiences
* Name written in bold letters in the middle of the card.
* The person's experiences(with italic font)
* **Photos are interactive buttons**, that redirects to the site about the experience when clicked.
* The area where the experiences are written also has a **scrolling feature** so **unlimited experience** can be written.
